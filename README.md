# About:
In this project, I implement an AVL tree given a framework. This assignment was due on November 17th.

# Files:
1. AVLTree.java

In this file, I coded the insert(), insertHelper(), remove(), removeHelper(), updateHeight(), getBalance(), reBalance(), rightRotate(), and leftRotate() methods. the 'Helper' methods are recursive methods that are called in their respective 'main' methods. For example, insertHelper() is a recursive method called by insert(). 

2. TreeNode.java

Class file for the TreeNode object.
